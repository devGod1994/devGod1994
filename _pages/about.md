I obtained a Ph.D. in the [School of Engineering, IT and Physical Sciences](https://federation.edu.au/schools/school-of-engineering-information-technology-and-physical-sciences) at [Federation University](https://federation.edu.au), Australia, under [Dr. Jiangang Ma](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=1DX4WFkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Sunil Aryal](http://sunilaryal.github.io/). I am broadly interested in **machine learning**, **data mining**, and application of AI/ML/DL in **Healthcare**.
